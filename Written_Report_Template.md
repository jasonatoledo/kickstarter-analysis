# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is interested in starting a Kickstarter campaign for her theater production. She wants to better understand how other similar campaigns have fared in the past by using a thorough data analysis. 
### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis through excel is to provide Louise with factual data about past campaigns and their success rates. In addition, this analysis will help discover any trends and patterns in the data to help Louise plan and prepare for her campaign.
## Analysis and Challenges
After doing a bit of data cleanup, I was able to create meaningful chart visualizations and pivot tables to help Louise understand when the most successful campaigns are and the success rate of campaigns by goal amount. I built a descriptive statistics supportive analysis to provide additional information to help Louise further understand how successful and failed campaigns compared.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
There are two noticable conclusions that Louise can draw from the Outcomes Based on Launch Date analysis. The first conclusion we can draw is that the most successful campaigns are started in the month of May, with the best season being late Spring through Summer. The second conclusion about the data is the least successful campaigns begin in the month of December, with the preceding and following months being next worst overall. Another  data point is there have been no cancelled campaigns in the month of October, but there isn't enough data to understand the reasoning behind this.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The conclusion I can draw about the Outcomes Based on Goals is that the most successful campaigns quantity-wise have a goal with the range of $1000 to $4999. The highest percentage of successful campaigns are in the "less than 1000" range. 61.6% of campaigns failed once the goal was $15000 or higher.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is interested in starting a Kickstarter campaign for her theater production. She wants to better understand how other similar campaigns have fared in the past by using a thorough data analysis. 
### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis through excel is to provide Louise with factual data about past campaigns and their success rates. In addition, this analysis will help discover any trends and patterns in the data to help Louise plan and prepare for her campaign.
## Analysis and Challenges
After doing a bit of data cleanup, I was able to create meaningful chart visualizations and pivot tables to help Louise understand when the most successful campaigns are and the success rate of campaigns by goal amount. I built a descriptive statistics supportive analysis to add additional information to help Louise further understand how successful and failed campaigns compared.
